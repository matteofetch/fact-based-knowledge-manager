| ----- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| **1** | Rewards Network (RN) is a network of ~18 000 local restaurants whose receipts earn a %-back reward and will be ingested as regular Fetch offers. | 2025-04-15 |
| **2** | RN integration currently has ~11,287 live offers (scaled from initial 140), with location matching and credit card capture issues having limited the rollout from the planned 14 400. | 2025-06-11 |
| **6** | Key results include generating $10.6 M ARR by EOQ2 2025 and $11.6 M revenue in FY25. Current ARR is $8.7M as of June 2025. | 2025-06-11 |
