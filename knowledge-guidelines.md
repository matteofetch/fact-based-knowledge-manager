# Knowledge Management Guidelines

## About This Knowledge Base
This is a fact-based knowledge management system for tracking project information. Each fact has a number, description, and validation date. The goal is maintaining accurate, current, and useful information that serves as a reliable source for answering operational questions.

## Core Principles

1. Operational Utility Focus
- Prioritize facts that help users understand current system operations over historical project details
- Ask: "Would this fact help someone understand how the system works today?"
- Keep historical context only when it explains current state or decisions

2. Temporal Clarity
- Distinguish between current operational facts ("X system processes Y") vs historical/planning facts ("Phase N aimed to achieve Y")
- Remove outdated project terminology from operational facts while preserving it in historical timeline facts
- Convert completed planning items from future tense ("will implement") to appropriate current state ("implemented" or "was planned")

3. Information Currency
- Update facts with current data when available (actual performance vs forecasts, current metrics vs estimates)
- Track validation dates - more recent validation indicates more reliable information
- Replace outdated targets/goals with current reality when projects are complete

4. Context Enhancement
- Add relevant context about why decisions were made, what problems were solved, or what challenges occurred
- This helps users understand not just what happened but why, making facts more actionable

## Fact Management Best Practices

Content Quality:
- Each fact should be specific, actionable, and contribute to system understanding
- Fact Completeness: Every fact must make sense as a standalone statement with sufficient context - avoid facts that require other facts to be understood
- Duplication Prevention: Always check existing facts before adding new content. Search for related concepts, similar metrics, or overlapping information to avoid creating duplicate or conflicting facts
- Objectivity Maintenance: Store only directly observable facts and measurable data. Facts must describe what happened, not what it means.

Prohibited content in facts:
- Interpretive language: "suggests," "indicates," "appears to show," "likely means," "may impact," "potential," "concerning trends"
- Analysis or conclusions: "churn problem," "performance challenges," "systematic issue"
- Speculation about causes: "due to," "because of," "resulting from" (unless directly confirmed)
- Future implications: "may lead to," "could result in," "risks causing"

Required approach: Record raw data points and measurements only. Save analysis, interpretation, causes, and implications for conversation or separate analysis sessions.

Examples:
- Good: "Card capture rate declined from 54.1% to 53.8% over two weeks"
- Bad: "Card capture rate declined from 54.1% to 53.8%, indicating a concerning trend"

- Eliminate redundancy through smart consolidation when multiple facts cover the same concept
- Keep facts separate when they address distinct aspects better understood individually

Language Standards:
- Use present tense for current operations ("system does X")
- Use past tense for completed project activities ("rollout completed in April")
- Avoid future tense unless describing confirmed future plans
- Update terminology consistently across related facts when changes occur

Structural Organization:
- Maintain consistent numbering even when deleting facts (gaps are acceptable)
- Update validation dates when facts are modified or confirmed
- Group related concepts logically while keeping individual facts atomic

## Document Integration Process
When incorporating new information from external documents:

1. Analysis Phase:
- Identify what information is new vs. confirms existing facts
- Note any contradictions or evolutions from current facts
- Distinguish project-relevant information from personal/task-specific details

2. Implementation:
- Update terminology consistently across all related facts
- Preserve valuable historical context that explains current decisions
- Track status evolution clearly (implemented vs. planned vs. historical)
- Use judgment to integrate information while maintaining fact completeness and context standards

## Knowledge Management Tasks System
- Proactively identify information gaps, outdated content, and improvement opportunities
- Prioritize high-impact updates (performance metrics, operational status) over lower-priority restructuring
- Use task tracking to manage ongoing knowledge base maintenance
- Filter out personal tasks that don't belong in shared knowledge management

## Decision-Making Framework
When uncertain about fact management decisions:
1. Utility Test: Does this change make the knowledge base more useful for current operations?
2. Clarity Test: Does this change make information clearer and more accessible?
3. Currency Test: Does this change improve information accuracy and timeliness?
4. Context Test: Does this change help users understand not just what but why?
5. Completeness Test: Can this fact be understood without requiring other facts for context?
