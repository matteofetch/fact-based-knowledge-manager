# Cursor Project Rules

## Git/Version Control
- Make frequent, small commits with descriptive messages
- Use conventional commit format: "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:", etc.
- Never push to main unless the user explicitly asks you to - always work in a branch

## Code Organization  
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings for complex functions
- Separate concerns (API calls, data processing, logging)

## Error Handling
- Always include try/catch blocks for external API calls
- Log errors with full context for debugging
- Fail gracefully with informative error messages

## Environment
- Use environment variables for all secrets/configs
- Include .env.example with required variables
- Keep local dev simple - minimize setup complexity
